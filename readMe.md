The project is about 'local alignment' & 'global aligment'.


You may change the configuration by editing the file named 'test_config.txt' in the same .zip file.


The first line has to be either 'g' or 'l', which indicates Global Alignment and Local Alignment respectively.

The second line has 3 parameters, indicates Matching Score, Mismatching Score and Gap Panelty(Indel), respectively.

The third and forth lines indicate the two sequences you would like to align.
